# Natural_Language_Processing

Natural language processing is an area of research in computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with processing natural languages such as English or Mandarin. This processing generally involves translating natural language into data (numbers) that a computer can use to learn about the world. And this understanding of the world is sometimes used to generate natural language text that reflects that understanding. (Hobson Lane, Cole Howard, Hannes Hapke)

## 1. Twitter data and sentimental analysis

To run the code, first, need to add your twitter API TOKEN in 'twitter_credentials.py'.

Here, I demonstrated how to use Twitter API to (1) collect Twitter data; (2) clean the data; (3) extract keywords and visualize the keywords in wordcloud; (4) run a sentimental analysis using textblob or LSTM
